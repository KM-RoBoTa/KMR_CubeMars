# Introduction {#mainpage}
[TOC]

This library allows the easy control of CubeMars AK motors in MIT mode. \n 
It is written in C++ for the Linux OS, but has only been tested with Archlinux ARM. \n 
It uses SI units, the only exception being temperature expressed in Â°C instead of Kelvins.

**Requirement**: depending on your hardware, a CAN controller might be necessary. For example, if using a Raspberry Pi, you can use a [CAN module containing a MCP2515 CAN controller with an SPI interface](https://joy-it.net/en/products/SBC-CAN01).
