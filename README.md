# Library for CubeMars AK motors in MIT mode, in C++

This library allows the easy control of CubeMars AK motors in MIT mode. <br /> 
It is written in C++ for the Linux OS, but has only been tested with Archlinux ARM. <br /> 
It uses SI units, the only exception being temperature expressed in Â°C instead of Kelvins.

In addition to a full documentation, this library also provides several examples to illustrate its use.<br /> 
To get the most complete documentation, it is recommended to regenerate the doxygen version locally.

**Requirement**: depending on your hardware, a CAN controller might be necessary. For example, if using a Raspberry Pi, you can use a [CAN module containing a MCP2515 CAN controller with an SPI interface](https://joy-it.net/en/products/SBC-CAN01).
